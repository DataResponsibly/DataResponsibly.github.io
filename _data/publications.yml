- title: "A Nutritional Label for Rankings"
  image: ranking-facts.png
  description: A Web-based application that generates a "nutritional label" for rankings. Ranking Facts is made up of a collection of visual widgets that implement our latest research results on fairness, stability, and transparency for rankings, and that communicate details of the ranking methodology, or of the output, to the end user.

- title: "Online Set Selection with Fairness and Diversity Constraints"
  authors: Julia Stoyanovich, Ke Yang and HV Jagadish
  image: online_selection_edbt18.png
  description: Selection algorithms usually score individual items in isolation, and then select the top scoring items. However, often there is an additional diversity objective. Since diversity is a group property, it does not easily jibe with individual item scoring.
