## Summary

Big data technology holds incredible promise of improving peopleâ€™s lives,
accelerating scientific discovery and innovation, and bringing about positive
societal change. Yet, if not used responsibly, this technology can propel economic
inequality, destabilize global markets and affirm systemic bias.
While the potential benefits of big data are well-accepted,
the importance of using these techniques in a fair and transparent
manner is rarely considered.
